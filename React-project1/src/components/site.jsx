    <h2>Gaurdian Classes</h2>
    <p>
      When you first log into Destiny 2. You get the oportunity to customize
      how your gaurdian is going to look like, whether you want your gaurdian
      to be Male/Female and the rest is up to you how you want your character
      is going to look like. But enough about that, you get to choose between
      three classes the Warlock, the Hunter or the Titan. You do not only have
      one choice between the classes so if you chose one class and it didn`t
      fit your playstyle, then you have the opportunity to try out the other`s
      as well.

    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <p>
      There are currently three Classes in Destiny 2: Hunter, Titan, and
      Warlock. While none is more powerful than another, they each have their
      own strengths and weaknesses. The most important difference between them
      all are the abilities found within the subclasses and the perk trees.
      <br /><br />
      Each Class has five subclasses: Arc, Solar, Void, Stasis and Strand.
      Within these subclasses are Aspects and Fragments that alter builds as
      well as different Super options. Use the links below to jump to the
      subclass of your choice.
